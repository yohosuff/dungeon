# Dungeon

A multiplayer game.

# Ideas

- player 'characters' remain in the game world when player logs out... and can starve to death if they don't eat
- a bridge that can only be crossed by two players working together
- tiles that you can fall into and die (slowly scale down player character until it disappears; or lands on spikes?)
- tiles that you cannot move through (ie. walls)
- tiles that you can move (and possibly block exits or food sources with)
- players need to eat to survive, and need to find food before they can eat
- players eventually get tired and need to sleep... IN REALTIME!!!! (ie. things can kill them while they sleep)
